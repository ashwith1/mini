# Literature Review: Overview of Existing NLP models and Techniques used that helps in making Chatbot

Introduction:
Chatbots have become an essential tool in various domains, including customer service, healthcare, and education.
We will be making conversational chatbot that helps the user and provide information to them about the SRH University.

We will be using existing NLP Models for Chatbot Development:

1) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
It uses bidirectional training of Transformer encoders to achieve SOTA(state-of-the-art) results on a variety of NLP tasks.

2) GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) (this is the reason I chose this model)
GPT-2 generate human-like text, effective in creating conversational agents.

3) Rasa
It combines machine learning and rule-based approaches and includes tools for intent recognition, entity extraction, and dialogue management.

Applications in Academic Support Chatbots
Academic support chatbots leverage these NLP advancements to assist students with various queries, including:

- Course Information: Providing details on course schedules, requirements, and content.
- Administrative Support: Answering questions about registration deadlines, financial aid, and university policies.
- Study Assistance: Offering guidance on study materials, exam preparation, and academic resources.

Conclusion
Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT have set new standards in NLP, enabling chatbots to understand and generate human-like text. 
Future research and development will likely focus on improving the integration of these models with real-time data and enhance their multilingual capabilities.
